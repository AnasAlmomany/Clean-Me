# ToDo
- Add reference to [monolingual](https://github.com/IngmarStein/Monolingual) for deleting extra language packs.
- Add reference to [App Cleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/( for deleting apps and leftovers.
- Add reference to [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com) and/or [Disk Inventory X](http://www.derlien.com) to see which other large files are on your mac.
- Add reference to a blog post of mine.
- See if there are any other files that can be cleaned (if one wants too). (E.g. see if it's safe to clean ~/Library/Caches and make an option for ~/Downloads).
